# Oxide 🧪

Welcome to **Oxide** – a cutting-edge programming language designed to be concise, flexible, and powerful. Oxide combines the ease and expressiveness of dynamically typed languages with the robustness and performance of statically typed languages.

## Why Oxide? 🚀

### 🌟 **Dynamic Yet Type-Safe**
Oxide offers full type inference, eliminating the need for explicit type annotations while maintaining complete type safety. Write clean and readable code without sacrificing performance or safety.

### ⚡ **Efficient and Fast**
Functions and lambdas in Oxide are inlined, ensuring minimal overhead. Collection operations like `map`, `flatMap`, and `sumOf` are optimized for speed, outperforming Javas Stream Api.

### 🌐 **Public by Default**
Designed to reduce boilerplate, Oxide functions and variables are public by default. Focus on writing your logic, not on repetitive access modifiers.

### 🔒 **Controlled Unsafe Operations**
Oxide provides `std::unsafe` for byte casting primitives, enabling low-level operations when needed. This feature ensures memory safety while offering the flexibility required for specific algorithms.

### 🎨 **Concise and Readable**
Oxide's syntax is designed to be intuitive and expressive, reducing mental overhead and making your code easier to understand and maintain.

### 🧩 **Feature-Rich Standard Library**
Oxide comes with a robust standard library that supports a wide range of functionalities, from high-level collection operations to efficient low-level manipulations.
